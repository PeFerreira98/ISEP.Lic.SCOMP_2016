mplement a program that allows to optimize the search of words in a set of text
files in parallel/concurrent environment.
The parent process should:
Create an area of shared memory.  The memory area must contain, for each
child process, the following information:
–
path to the file;
–
word to search;
–
an integer to store the number of occurrences.

Create 10 new processes;

Fill the shared memory area with the information for each child process;

Wait until the child processes finish their search;

Print the number of occurrences determined by each child;

Eliminate the shared memory area.
Each child process should:

Open the text file assigned to it by the parent (can/should be different for
each child process);

Determine the number of occurrences of the word to search;

Write the number of occurrences in their position in the shared memory area.

  Implement a program that creates a new process.  One will be the
producer
and
the other the
consumer
.  Among them should be created a circular buffer to store
10 integers and the necessary synchronization variables in a shared memory area.
The
producer
puts increasing values in the buffer that should be printed by the
consumer
. Consider that 30 values are exchanged between them.
